1. How do I create a hidden file or folder?

If we want to create a plain text file in cli, first we have to go to our working folder.
Then we have to write "mkdir nameOfFile" or "touch nameOfFile.txt" then hit enter.
Now we have a txt file in our selected folder.

But if we want to create a hidden file or folder, then we have to add a dot "."
before our folder or file name.

For example;
$ mkdir .nameOfFile

For listing our files or folders, we need to write "ls".
But in this case we couldn't see secret files or folders.
Because of this we have to add "-a"

For example;
$ ls -a

Sometimes it’s easier to view the items in a folder in a list format, like the Details view in File Explorer in Windows. The following command lists all files, hidden and not hidden, in a detailed list format:

$ ls -al

2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

We can create multiple sub-directories by a single command from Linux like:

mkdir -p /data/rs1 /data/rs2 /data/rs3

In other example;
$ mkdir -p  /c/Users/Desktop/FirstFolder/SecondFolder/ThirdFolder

3.How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message

As we learned in the lecture, if we want to write a message to a file,
we use >
For example;

$ echo "first message" > "fileName.txt"

In order to append a second message, we have to use ">>"
For example;

$ echo "second message" >> "fileName.txt"
